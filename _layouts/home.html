      Although the Modular-in-One looks like an All-in-One it does not inherit the many drawbacks of the All-in-One form factor. It is as fast as a desktop and almost as cost efficient. It merges the best of Desktop, mini-PC and All-in-One. Cherry picking the best of all is not a new thing. "Making it so" for form factors is quite another. But don't take our word for it â€” check for yourself!

          Largest Form Factor Envelope by Modular-in-One<br>
          <small>Why Modular-in-One is simply always your best choice.</small>
        </h3>
        <div class="tab-content">
          <div class="tab-pane active" id="envelope-form-factor">
          <p><strong>Form Factor Envelope:</strong> Every computer system has a range of conditions under which it will work optimally. This is its envelope. It is not just performance, but the envelope also considers the display, the cost, clean desk and many other factors. The wider the envelope, the more versatile your computer is. Computers are made of form factors. Choosing the right form factor was critical, because you needed to make tradeoffs. The form factor which was strong in one direction was severely limited in others. Here are 12 main factors that characterize the capabilities of a form factor. The form factor envelope diagram explains visually how Modular-in-One pushes the envelope to encompass all key features. Skeptical? Click each feature and each form factor for more information. Note: For sake of simplicity we removed the mini-PC from the form factor envelope chart, because its features will always be rated between the desktop and All-in-One PC. Compliments and thanks go to <a href="https://blog.mingthein.com/2014/06/11/shooting-envelope-what-does-it-mean/" target="_blank">Ming Thein for introducing the idea of product use envelope chart</a> to us.</p>
        </div>
          <div class="tab-pane" id="envelope-why">
            <p><strong>Why you want it: <em>When shopping:</em></strong> Until now form factor limitations forced you to make sacrifices when shopping for a new computer. Spending your hard earned cash not on a great solution, but merely on the lesser evil is frustrating â€” not to mention time consuming. Imagine, not needing to make these choices and sacrifices any more. What if there were a form factor that does it all? Enter the Modular-in-One. Because it contains the envelope of all other form factors it makes your choice simple: The Modular-in-One is always the best choice. <strong><em>In Use:</em></strong> If in the past your use case shifted outside your computer's form factor envelope you were left with but two choices: Buy a new computer or suffer. The Modular-in-One encompasses a much larger envelope to begin with. And in the rare case that you find yourself using your computer outside its envelope, than you can upgrade it to contain your new use case.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="tab-pane" id="envelope-display-freedom">
            <p><strong>Display Freedom:</strong> Power users know that choosing the right display can make a difference like day and night. There is so much to say that we dedicated the next module to this topic. Suffice to say here, that All-in-Ones offer very limited choices, whereas desktops provide the most freedom, as you can freely choose any possible combination of features from virtually thousands of displays. The Modular-in-One offers you the same, hence full score as well. In case you look very closely you will find that All-in-Ones require their display to have VESA mount, whereas desktops don't. However, the 100% mark is based not on the total number of displays but on having the freedom to find any display feature combination you want in a display. This is as true for displays with VESA mount as it is for all displays, as most displays have VESA mount and as such you still can choose from thousands of displays.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="tab-pane" id="envelope-mix-match">
            <p><strong>Mix & Match:</strong> All-in-Ones come with only a few base configurations and only a few parts can be customized. As a consequence it may happen to you that when needing one part in a better grade you are forced to upgrade several other parts too, paying for better features you do not need. This sounds more complicated than it is. There is a diagram that visualizes this using displays as an example in the Mix & Match tab in the next module about display freedom.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="tab-pane" id="envelope-fluid-factor">
            <p><strong>Fluid Form Factor:</strong> Both desktop and All-in-One lock you into their form factor. If your use case changes and you need the other form factor than you have no choice but to suffer or to buy a complete new computer again. Whereas the Modular-in-One allows you the conversion from one form factor to another at any time. Let's demonstrate the usefulness with but one example: Say you use a powerful All-in-One as your workstation, but you need to travel with your computer to another location. Shipping an All-in-One is expensive and risky. With the Modular-in-One you can detach the small PC unit and simply bring it with you in your briefcase. In other words, you converted the All-in-One form factor to a mini-PC.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="tab-pane" id="envelope-portability">
            <p><strong>Portability</strong> Some All-in-Ones are very easy to bring to other locations. Desktops are a nightmare to move. Enough said! The Modular-in-One is more heavy than a similar All-in-One, but it comes with a carry grip, a keyboard holder and you can add accessories to hold all your other desktop stuff too, making it jaw droppingly fast to move and get going again after you arrive.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="tab-pane" id="envelope-clean-desk">
            <p><strong>Clean Desk:</strong> Desktops offer you two choices: A) you make no effort and their cables make your desk look messy or B) you mount the cables to the desk, using a lot of time and reducing poor portability to none. Either one is annoying and hence poor marks for the desktop. All-in-Ones have been the pinnacle of clean computer desks. Hence their popularity over desktops and mini PCs despite their many other drawbacks. The Modular-in-One inherits the functionality of the All-in-One in terms of clean desk.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="tab-pane" id="envelope-speakers">
            <p><strong>Speaker:</strong> For all traditional form factors you can choose either speakers integrated into the display or external speakers. The integrated speakers are very convenient and provide a clean desk, but to many people they do not sound clear and full. Thus the popularity of external speakers. Unfortunately they come with additional cables, cluttering your desk and reducing portability. Hence no full score for external speakers either. The Modular-in-One offers one additional speaker solution where you mount its system speakers (including its cables) to the Modular-in-One platform. Now you have everything: Clear and full sound, clean desk, and portability.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="tab-pane" id="envelope-cost">
            <p><strong>Cost Efficiency:</strong> All-in-One's are more expensive to begin with. Add to that the shorter life-span and reduced reparability, and you end up with significantly larger total cost of ownership, respectively very low cost efficiency. Instead the Modular-in-One has virtually the same low total cost of ownership of a desktop PC. The only difference is the added cost for the Modular-in-One platform, such as ViDock-One.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="tab-pane" id="envelope-life">
            <p><strong>Lifespan:</strong> All-in-One's are slower to begin with, so they become obsolete that much sooner. Combine this with little to no upgradeability, and there is simply not much you can do to extend its life span. Instead the Modular-in-One starts faster. And if one part gets too slow you can easily swap it out for a faster one. You even do not need to retire the whole unit at the same time. ViDock-One is designed to last 50 years. Your display, speaker, power supply and case may last 15 years. Your motherboard may last eight and your CPU, memory and disk about four years.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="tab-pane" id="envelope-performance">
            <p><strong>Performance:</strong> All-in-Ones often use mobile components and are built to be thin, resulting in less space for components and cooling. Consequently, CPU and GPU performances typically range from 50% to 70% lower when compared to a desktop. Modular-in-One gains full marks because it is made of desktop parts with full performance and full cooling capabilities.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="tab-pane" id="envelope-eco">
            <p><strong>Eco-Friendly:</strong> All-in-Ones have a much shorter lifespan to begin with. Combine this with poor upgradability and reparability and any part that becomes too slow or breaks results in the replacement of the complete â€” and quite big â€” unit, thus producing lots of trash and consuming lots of raw materials to produce a replacement. Instead the Modular-in-One is the exact opposite of all that, resulting in a fraction of trash-footprint, as well as material and carbon dioxide foot-print. See â†’ ???</p>
          </div>
          <div class="tab-pane" id="envelope-upgrade">
            <p><strong>Upgradeable:</strong> Desktops always have been the gold standard for upgradability, consequently they earn full marks with flying colors. All-in-Ones on the other hand have been the antithesis of upgradeability, hence the dismal rating. You may even get the feeling that obsolescence was a design goal. And quite the opposite again for the Modular-in-One, which is being made completely of modular desktop parts and as such inheriting the best in class upgradeability. Consequently full score as well.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="tab-pane" id="envelope-repair">
            <p><strong>Reparability:</strong> When something goes wrong with an All-in-One, it all goes wrong. Poor upgradeability also means poor reparability. Instead the Modular-in-One is easy to repair, thanks to being made of modular desktop parts. Simply swap out the broken part!</p>
          </div>
          <div class="tab-pane" id="envelope-all-in-one">
            <p><strong>All-in-One:</strong> Exactly like its name promises, the All-in-One delivers everything in one case. This makes it super-fast to set up, or even to bring it to a new location. A simplicity that keeps your desk clean. This sleek design is what make the All-in-One very popular. Sadly in every other direction the All-in-One is severely limited.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="tab-pane" id="envelope-desktop">
            <p><strong>Desktop:</strong> The desktop is the workhorse. You want highest performance, lowest cost, best upgradeability. The desktop is your form factor. No other had such a large envelope. The desktop shined in every direction, except for portability and clean desk, which remained the unchallenged domain of the All-in-One. The form factor envelope chart explains visually why a desktop user was not happy with an All-in-One and vice versa. Each form factor's strengths were not overlapping at all in their respective envelopes!</p>
          </div>
          <div class="tab-pane" id="envelope-modular">
            <p><strong>Modular-in-One:</strong> The new kid on the block. A community open source development driven by the mission to do away with the limitations of other form factors. To create one form factor that fits all. The form factor envelope visually shows the success of this mission. This larger envelope will increase the computer's life span. Saving the user's money and reducing the ecological footprint.</p>

                <p style="line-height: 1.8em;padding-top: 10px;">The display is the single most important interface to your computer. That's why they come with a staggering amount of sizes and features. Power users know that picking the right combination of size, resolution and features for your application will make a huge difference. In turn, leaving features you do not need behind will save you hundreds of dollars. Desktop users have enjoyed this modularity since 1981. For All-in-One users this modularity is introduced for the first time with the Modular-in-One form factor.</p>
              </div>
              <div class="tab-pane" id="display-independent-desc">
                <p style="line-height: 1.8em;padding-top: 10px;">When buying an All-in-One the better displays are tied to better CPU, better GPU and bigger disks. With Modular-in-One we empower you to choose every component independently and tailored to your needs. e.g. you may pair a big display with a small CPU if all you want to do is watching movies.</p>
              </div>
              <div class="tab-pane" id="display-upgrade-desc">
                <p style="line-height: 1.8em;padding-top: 10px;">Say you own a Mini-PC and a display. Thanks to the modular nature of Modular-in-One you can keep your computer parts and upgrade them to an All-in-One form factor. If you already own a Modular-in-One, then you can upgrade the display or the computer independently, while keeping the remaining parts. This extends the life span of your computer parts, thus saving you money and it saves our planet's resources while avoiding toxic computer trash.</p>

                <p style="line-height: 1.8em;padding-top: 10px;">Obviously modularity is the key. ViDock-One supports the industry standard VESA mount with both sizes 75mm and 100mm, which are the used sizes in the supported display size range of 17" â€¦ 34". ViDock-One supports heavy displays of up to 15kg. The VESA-mounting plate is small, to be compatible to a 100mm recessed VESA mount, as it is common with some display vendors, such as Dell.</p>

That's why they come with a staggering amount of sizes and features. Power users know that picking the right combination of size, resolution and features for your application will make a huge difference. In turn, leaving features you do not need behind will save you hundreds of dollars. Desktop users have enjoyed this modularity since 1981. For All-in-One users this modularity is introduced for the first time with the Modular-in-One form factor.</p>

                    <p class="visible-xs visible-sm"><strong>Mix & Match:</strong> When buying an All-in-One the better displays are tied to better CPU, better GPU and bigger disks. With Modular-in-One we empower you to choose every component independently and tailored to your needs. e.g. you may pair a big display with a small CPU if all you want to do is watching movies.</p>

                    <p class="visible-xs visible-sm"><strong>Upgradability:</strong> Say you own a Mini-PC and a display. Thanks to the modular nature of Modular-in-One you can keep your computer parts and upgrade them to an All-in-One form factor. If you already own a Modular-in-One, then you can upgrade the display or the computer independently, while keeping the remaining parts. This extends the life span of your computer parts, thus saving you money and it saves our planet's resources while avoiding toxic computer trash.</p>

                    <p class="visible-xs visible-sm"><strong>How it works:</strong> Obviously modularity is the key. ViDock-One supports the industry standard VESA mount with both sizes 75mm and 100mm, which are the used sizes in the supported display size range of 17" â€¦ 34". ViDock-One supports heavy displays of up to 15kg. The VESA-mounting plate is small, to be compatible to a 100mm recessed VESA mount, as it is common with some display vendors, such as Dell.</p>

      We are designers, engineers, photographers, and gamers who are very passionate and particular about our computer stations. Frankly, we wanted it all: The modularity of the desktop and the compactness and good looks of the All-in-One. This is why we designed ViDock-One as the first Modular-in-Oneâ„¢ system. To give all of us the power to fully customize our computer stations. So they become an expression of personal style while at the same time being most functional with your individual balance of performance, features and cost.
