                <p><strong>Photo and Design:</strong> Designers and photographers enjoy using a stylish computer, hence the controversial popularity of the All-in-One form factor. But creatives also need powerful desktop 3D cards and frequent CPU upgrading. This makes traditional All-in-Ones expensive. The modular nature of ViDock-One to the rescue! For the first time, you can bring your (4K / 8K) workstation with you. Don't chain your creativity to your desk!</p>
                <p><strong>Video:</strong> All that applies to 3D Design and Photo applies to professional video production as well. And there is the added use case of bringing your 4K / 8k workstation to the location – enabling you to make the judgement call correctly if the shot made the cut. Utilize your down time on location to begin color grading and editing on a full-fledged video editing workstation.</p>

                <p><strong>Students:</strong> The compact ViDock-One fits into the tight space of a dormitory. Its portability is ideal to bring it to your study group or to a game party. When going home for the holidays, simply undock the computer module from the Modular-in-One platform. Now it fits in your briefcase.</p>
                <p><strong>Parents:</strong> You want to see more of your kid(s), bring the ViDock-One gaming rigs to the living room. You need some quiet time, then bring the rigs to their friends for a game tournament. Reclaim control while adding to their fun.</p>
                <p><strong>Education:</strong> The Modular-in-One is the new form factor of choice for teaching! It combines the same lowest total cost of ownership of a desktop with an even lower footprint than an All-in-One. But its portability is second to none, resulting in higher flexibility that increases the ROI even further.</p>
